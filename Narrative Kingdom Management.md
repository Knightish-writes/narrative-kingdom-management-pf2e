# Important Terms

## Clocks
  A clock is used to track an ongoing effort or project in the kingdom, much like victory points. When working on a project, leaders in the kingdom will be required to fill a clock with a number of segments related to that project.

## Leaders
  A PC who has taken a role in the kingdom is a leader in that kingdom. They can create projects and resolve Kingdom Events. They also benefit from Kingdom Benefits.

# Narrative Kingdom Management
## The Kingdom Turn
  One week per month must be spent on the leaders of a kingdom deciding how the kingdom should evolve. If this time is not spent in the kingdom, the kingdom loses XP equal to the number of leaders who did not appear to manage the kingdom.
  There are two main phases to the Kingdom Turn. **Kingdom Projects** and **Kingdom Events**.

## Kingdom Projects
  At the beginning of each Kingdom Turn a leader may choose to begin a **Kingdom Project**. This can be something as simple as “Building a Fountain” or as complex as “Training the Sootscale Kobolds to be a secondary fighting force.” A project’s complexity is represented by the number of segments on its project clock. Either being four segments, six segments, or ten segments.
  Attempting to fill a clock’s segment takes a full day of the Kingdom Turn. During that day, the player will roll a skill check against the kingdom’s level DC (using the DC by Level Table) to fill the clock. If the skill is especially relevant (i.e. Crafting used for making a building) then the GM may choose to make the Easy DC adjustment on the project check. If the skill chosen doesn’t seem relevant, the GM may decide to use the Hard DC adjustment. A Critical Success fills two segments on the clock, a Success increases one segment on the clock, a Failure doesn’t adjust the clock, and a Critical failure loses one segment on the clock.
  If a leader decides to forego advancing their own projects to help another leader with theirs, they use the _Aid_ activity to assist with the check.
  A leader can have up to three ongoing projects, but each one must be of a different complexity. Meaning a single leader can not have three four segment projects.
  A project’s complexity and effect are decided between the GM and the player. Filling a project can provide some effect depending on its complexity; however, the main benefit to completing projects is Kingdom XP and Advancement.

> For example, Jeremy wants a fountain built to Gozreh, his character’s goddess. After a bit of discussion, the GM determines that a fountain is a pretty piece of architecture that makes the town a better place, but it’s not a particularly difficult thing to make. The GM decides it would be a four segment clock to complete the project. They both agree that building this fountain would not have much effect on the Kingdom or Jeremy’s character so they both decide to have no additional effects.

> Another example, Lily wants to craft weapons for the kingdom’s army before they head out to war. She and her GM agree that this will take some time and make a decision to have it be a six segmented clock. Lily and the GM then discuss potential benefits, the GM states Lily will have a +1 status bonus to her next recall knowledge check regarding wars and warfare.

### Project Rewards
  While rewards for completing a project could be anything, it’s recommended that rewards be something non-permanent to either the player or the kingdom. This means the best options are bonuses to checks until the start of the next kingdom turn, a consumable item for the leader, or even providing a small bonus to the next Kingdom Event.
  If you do wish to make a permanent change, be considerate when thinking about the kingdom’s abilities holistically. Letting a player use a project to gain the ability to purchase a single uncommon item before Kingdom Level 8 is beneficial, but be certain to inform the player that the kingdom will eventually allow them to buy all uncommon items at level 8 so they can make an informed decision about the project.

### Narrating Clocks
  It should be noted that filling a clock should be more than just rolling seven times and noting the result. The GM should be asking the player what they’re character is _doing_ to fulfill this project. Once a project fills a segment, it means something significant in the development has occurred. As such, GMs should be certain to provide some necessary weight to certain clocks through narration.
  In addition, if a clock is particularly complex, the GM can provide an adventure outside of the kingdom turn for the players to make significant progress in the clock.
  When finishing a project, the GM should provide some description about how it helps the leaders or the kingdom become a different place.

## Kingdom Events
  After spending a week working on projects a **Kingdom Event** may occur. Treat Kingdom Events as ten-segment clocks for the sake of resolving them and providing Kingdom XP. The difference is that events can be handled outside of the normal kingdom turn if players choose to spend downtime on it.
  
  At the end of each day, the opposing army rolls 2d6 to gain the following benefits:
  1-6: No Benefit
  7-9: The opposing army gains footing and gains a segment on the clock
  10+: The opposing army gains a huge win, they gain two segments on the clock.
  Warfare events do not benefit from abilities which lower the amount of segments needed to resolve Kingdom Events.

## Advancement
  The Kingdom receives XP according to the complexity of the project completed.
  
| Number of Segments | Amount of XP |
|----------|----------|
| 4 | 1XP |
| 6 | 2XP |
| 10 | 3XP |

  **The amount of XP needed to level up the kingdom is 3 multiplied by the number of leaders.** The kingdom’s level can never exceed the party level or the number of hexes claimed, whichever is lower.

### Leader’s Charisma
  Your power is known in the kingdom. When doing a _Request_, _Coerce_, _Lie_, or _Make an Impression_ activity a leader may invoke their position to give themselves a +1 status bonus to the check. This only works if the targeted creature respects or fears the authority of the leader.
  This benefit increases to a +2 at 5th level, a +3 at 10th level, and a +4 at 15th level.

### Insider Trading
  Your kingdom has excellent trade routes and you often find exactly what you’re looking for when buying something from your kingdom.
  Leaders may purchase common items in their kingdom of the kingdom’s level or lower.
  At kingdom level 8, trade has improved to provide uncommon items. At Kingdom Level 16, rare items become available for purchase.

### Collect Taxes
  Each leader gains an amount of gold as though successful from the _Earn Income_ activity using the kingdom’s level. They earn this amount of gold for every day of the Kingdom Turn, meaning you typically multiply the amount earned by seven.

### Gifts of Gratitude
  The citizens have decided to give gifts to their leaders! The players may choose a common or uncommon consumable item equal to or lower than level 6 to receive for free.

### Know Thy Enemy
  You understand much of the history of your neighbors. Leaders have a +1 status bonus when attempting to _Recall Knowledge_ about a location or people in the Stolen Lands.

### Problem Solvers
  Kingdom Events are now resolved using a six segmented clock. Resolving the event still provides 3XP.

### Lay of the Land
  You understand how to navigate The Stolen Lands easily. Leaders are able to do an additional activity when using hexploration.

### Easy Snack
  When exploring the Stolen Lands, you can feed off the land itself. You are always considered well-fed when using hexploration.

### Monster Slayers
  Your knowledge of the Stolen Lands has assisted you powerfully in understanding different monsters and their abilities. All leaders gain a +2 status bonus when attempting to _Recall Knowledge_ on a creature in the Stolen Lands.

### No Mountain High Enough
  When Hexploring the Stolen Lands, treat Difficult Terrain as standard terrain.

### Nothing Can Stop Us!
  Kingdom Events are now resolved using a four segmented clock. It still provides 3XP for resolving the problem.

### One Banner, One Flag
  When Aiding another leader with their project, treat the result as one degree of success higher.

### Prosperous Kingdom
  When you earn money from _Collect Taxes_ you treat it instead as a Critical Success on the Earn Income Table for the Kingdom’s level.

### Gifts of the Gods
  Your citizens, prosperous and happy, provide for you legendary items. Each leader may pick a unique item of item level 20 or lower.

### Lords of the Inner Sea
  All those in the region have heard your name. You gain the bonus from _Leader’s Charisma_ no matter who you talk to in the Inner Sea region.
