# Goals
## Simplification
  The purpose of these house rules are to simplify the kingdom management rules of Pathfinder 2E’s Kingmaker Adventure Path. As such, these rules care little about managing each individual city or managing trade agreements. We assume that happens during the week you spend on your projects.
  This also provides the PCs with some buffs and bonuses when in and around their kingdom for the sake of incentivizing them to continue to help it grow. As such, if you feel that these rules make your players too powerful or you would prefer something more granular then I would advise you to use [Vance and Kerenshara’s Kingdom Adjustments](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43r3b?Vance-and-Kerensharas-Comprehensive) or the [Pathfinder Ultimate Campaign](https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1488) rules from first edition.

## Rate of Advancement
  The rules provided here should have your kingdom level up every 3-4 kingdom turns. This is _much_ faster than the original rules have set up. The kingdom level is capped at the player level or the number of hexes that are claimed. This should incentivize the players to continue leveling up the kingdom and exploring new parts of the stolen lands.

## PC Involvement
  Due to the way the original Kingdom Management rules are structured the players are not involved in whether the kingdom succeeds or fails. Their skills are not important. This means there is a disconnect from some players who want more agency in the kingdom’s success. This system gives them that agency.
  In addition, projects and progress allow the players to focus on what their character would want to do for the kingdom and her people.
